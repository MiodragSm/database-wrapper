About
This is a beginners testing/learning project. Don't expect anything.


Installation
The easiest way to run this on a localhost is:

1. Install Wamp or similar package (Of course, you could install Apache, php and the rest separately if you want).
2. Copy all files from repository into appropriate localhost folder (wamp default is "./www")
2. Import sakila-db with following parameters:
	- server = "localhost"
	- database name = "sakila"
	- user = "root"
	- password = ""
	
3. Type "localhost" into the address bar of your browser, and you should see login screen if all is done correctly.
